M3U8
====

This is a most complete opensource library for parsing and generating of M3U8 playlists
used in HTTP Live Streaming (Apple HLS) for internet video translations.

M3U8 is simple text format and parsing library for it must be simple too. It did not offer
ways to play HLS or handle playlists over HTTP. So library features are:

* Support HLS specs up to version 5 of the protocol.
* Parsing and generation of master-playlists and media-playlists.
* Autodetect input streams as master or media playlists.
* Offer structures for keeping playlists metadata.
* Encryption keys support for use with DRM systems like [Verimatrix](http://verimatrix.com) etc.
* Support for non standard [Google Widevine](http://www.widevine.com) tags.

Library licensed under GPLv3. Copyleft by library authors (see [AUTHORS](AUTHORS)).

Install
-------

	go get github.com/grafov/m3u8

or get releases from https://github.com/grafov/m3u8/releases

Documentation [![Go Walker](http://gowalker.org/api/v1/badge)](http://gowalker.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8)
-------------

Package online documentation (examples included) available at:

* http://gowalker.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8
* http://godoc.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8

Supported by the HLS protocol tags and their library support explained in [M3U8 cheatsheet](M3U8.md).

Examples
--------

Parse playlist:

```go
	f, err := os.Open("playlist.m3u8")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	p, listType, err := DecodeFrom(bufio.NewReader(f), true)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	switch listType {
	case MEDIA:
	    mediapl := p.(*MediaPlaylist)
		fmt.Printf("%+v\n", mediapl)
	case MASTER:
	    masterpl := p.(*MasterPlaylist)
		fmt.Printf("%+v\n", masterpl)
	}
```

Then you get filled with parsed data structures. For master playlists you get ``Master`` struct with slice consists of pointers to ``Variant`` structures (which represent playlists to each bitrate).
For media playlist parser returns ``MediaPlaylist`` structure with slice of ``Segments``. Each segment is of ``MediaSegment`` type.
See ``structure.go`` or full documentation (link below).

You may use API methods to fill structures or create them manually to generate playlists. Example of media playlist generation:

```go
	p, e := NewMediaPlaylist(3, 10) // with window of size 3 and capacity 10
	if e != nil {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("Creating of media playlist failed: %s", e))
	}
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		e = p.Add(fmt.Sprintf("test%d.ts", i), 6.0, "")
		if e != nil {
			panic(fmt.Sprintf("Add segment #%d to a media playlist failed: %s", i, e))
		}
	}
	fmt.Println(p.Encode().String())
```

Library structure
-----------------

Library has compact code and bundled in three files:

* `structure.go` — declares all structures related to playlists and their properties
* `reader.go` — playlist parser methods
* `writer.go` — playlist generator methods

Each file has own test suite placed in `*_test.go` accordingly.

Library usage
-------------

This library successfully used in streaming software developed for my employer and tested with
generating of VOD and Live streams and parsing of Widevine Live streams. Also library usage noted
in opensource software:

* [Stream Surfer](http://streamsurfer.org) monitoring software.
* [gohls](https://github.com/kz26/gohls) — HLS downloader.

Project status [![Is maintained?](http://stillmaintained.com/grafov/m3u8.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/grafov/m3u8)
---------------

In development.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grafov/m3u8.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grafov/m3u8) for last commit from `master` or `draft` branches.

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/grafov/m3u8/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/grafov/m3u8/latest) for `master` branch.

Development rules:

* Feature changes first applied to `draft` branch then after minimal testing it will merge with `master` branch.
* Bugfixes or minor doc changes applied to `master` branch and then merged to `draft`.
* Code in `draft` branch may be in an inconsistent state.
* After complete testing and one week usage with my prober for HLS [Stream Surfer](http://streamsurfer.org) it may be released as new library version.
* Each new API call or M3U8 tag accompanied by at least with one unit test till new release (this rule will be apply after v1.0).
* Versioning scheme follows http://semver.org rules (but versions till v1.0 not support bacward compatibility, see release notes carefully).

Roadmap
-------

To version 1.0:

* Support all M3U8 tags up to latest version of specs.
* Code coverage by unit tests more than 90%
